    <h1>Experience</h1>

    <p>Prior to this class my only experience in web design was failing itd 110 once, then passing it the second time a
        year later.<b>
            I like to use vscode and github for making websites,<b> I would link the websites I've made in the past but
                they
                are on replit,<b>
                    which is no longer free to use so they aren't live anymore.
    </p>
