    <h1>Knowledge</h1>
    <p>I feel like most of the knowledge I gained from ITD 110 was based on website structure, and internet regulations
        as well as of course how to build a website. I learned about the basics of html writing, and structure. I don't
        think I have many strengths
        other than being good at cobbling pieces of code together from different sources. I would consider my weakness
        most things in this regard, I am trying
        to fix it.</p>
